## Question 1
1. Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed because automation testing requires scripts which are written to automatically test new and existing software based on certain events such as code getting pushed to the remote repository. Github action allows us to do this to make sure our code isn't running into any issues every time we add to it. Consistent testing is very important. 

## Question 2
No because that would just require a unit test rather than E2E testing. E2E testing will automate test cases that involve emulating user actions from start to finish/end to end so just checking one function doesn't require this whole process. E2E is for making sure many parts are all working together properly. A single unit test could be used instead for the function. 

## Question 3
The difference between navigation and snapshot mode is that navigation mode analyzes a page right after it loads and provide overall performance metric. Snapshot mode can't analyze JS performance like navigation mode does. Navigation mode resulted in many positive results with performance=99, accessibility=95, best practices=96, and SEO=91. Snapshot mode had less passed tests with 2/4 performance tests passed, 18/19 accessibility tests passed, 4/5 best practices tests passed, and 4/5 SEO tests passed.

## Question 4
Three things we could do to improve the CSE 110 shop site are improve accessibility, best practices, and SEO. Accessibility can be improved by specify a lang attribute since < html > element does not have a [ lang ] attribute. If the page isn't in the default language, the screen reader might not show the page's text correctly. Best practices can be improved by adding a < meta name="viewport" > tag with width or initial-scale. This optimizes the app for mobile screens and prevents a 300 ms delay to user input. SEO can be improved by adding meta description. These can be added in the search results to concisely summarize page content.
